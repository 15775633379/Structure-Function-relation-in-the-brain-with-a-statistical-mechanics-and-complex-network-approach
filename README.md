Using data from the HCP dataset, we study the topological properties of structural connectivity, functional connectivity, and simulated functional connectivity. We then compared these topological properties with psychological test scores for twelve subjects selected for having obtained extreme scores on these tests. We obtain that atypical subjects in the psychological test can be recognized as having atypical topological properties in their structural or functional connectivity.
